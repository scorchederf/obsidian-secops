The activity of assigning a new drive letter or creating a mount point for a data storage device, such as a USB, network share, or external hard drive, enabling access to its content on a host system. Examples: 

- USB Drive Insertion: A USB drive is plugged in and automatically assigned the letter `E:\` on a Windows machine.
- Network Drive Mapping: A network share `\\server\share` is mapped to the drive `Z:\`.
- Virtual Drive Creation: A virtual disk is mounted on `/mnt/virtualdrive` using an ISO image or a virtual hard disk (VHD).
- Cloud Storage Mounting: Google Drive is mounted as `G:\` on a Windows machine using a cloud sync tool.
- External Storage Integration: An external HDD or SSD is connected and assigned `/mnt/external` on a Linux system..
