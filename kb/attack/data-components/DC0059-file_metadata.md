# DC0059: File Metadata

contextual information about a file, including attributes such as the file's name, size, type, content (e.g., signatures, headers, media), user/owner, permissions, timestamps, and other related properties. File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: 

- File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM on Windows.
- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.
- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.
- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.
- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.
- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.
