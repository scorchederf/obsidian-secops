**This technique has been deprecated. Please use [Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571) where appropriate.**

Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend with normal network activity to avoid more detailed inspection. They may use commonly open ports such as

* TCP:80 (HTTP)
* TCP:443 (HTTPS)
* TCP:25 (SMTP)
* TCP/UDP:53 (DNS)

They may use the protocol associated with the port or a completely different protocol. 

For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), examples of common ports are 

* TCP/UDP:135 (RPC)
* TCP/UDP:22 (SSH)
* TCP/UDP:3389 (RDP)
